                <p>Coding is a creative process executed by computer programmers to tell a computer how to perform a task. Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program to accomplish a specific computing result or to perform a specific task. Programming involves tasks such as: analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming language (commonly referred to as coding).<br><br> The source code of a program is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer, often for solving a given problem.<br> Proficient programming thus often requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.In computer programming, readability refers to the ease with which a human reader can comprehend the purpose, control flow, and operation of source code. It affects the aspects of quality above, including portability, usability and most importantly maintainability.

                    Readability is important because programmers spend the majority of their time reading, trying to understand and modifying existing source code, rather than writing new source code. Unreadable code often leads to bugs, inefficiencies, and duplicated code.<br> A study[11] found that a few simple readability transformations made code shorter and drastically reduced the time to understand it.

                    Following a consistent programming style often helps readability. However, readability is more than just programming style. Many factors, having little or nothing to do with the ability of the computer to efficiently compile and execute the code, contribute to readability.üëçüèª</p>

                    You‚Äôve seen the craze for learning code. But what exactly is coding? Coding is what makes it possible for us to create computer software, apps and websites. Your browser, your OS, the apps on your phone, Facebook, and this website ‚Äì they‚Äôre all made with code.

                    Facebook Twitter LinkedIn
                    You‚Äôve seen the craze for learning code. But what exactly is coding? Coding is what makes it possible for us to create computer software, apps and websites. Your browser, your OS, the apps on your phone, Facebook, and this website ‚Äì they‚Äôre all made with code.



                    Here‚Äôs a simple example of code, written in the Python language:

                    print 'Hello, world!'
                    Many coding tutorials use that command as their very first example, because it‚Äôs one of the simplest examples of code you can have ‚Äì it ‚Äòprints‚Äô (displays) the text ‚ÄòHello, world!‚Äô onto the screen.

                    Coding 101
                    If you don‚Äôt know the first thing about coding, you‚Äôve come to the right <br>We‚Äôve put together a beginner‚Äôs tutorial which will give you all the background information you need on coding, before you start learning it for real.

                    It starts with an explanation on the benefits of learning coding. Here, you‚Äôll find out what you‚Äôll be able to do once you know how to work with code. Then, you‚Äôll get a deeper understanding of how coding works, and how the code you write gets converted into an instruction that a computer can ‚Äòunderstand‚Äô. Very satisfying to know!

                    That‚Äôs followed by an outline of today‚Äôs coding languages. After all, every language has a purpose ‚Äì some are for the web, others for app development, others for desktop software. You‚Äôll find out why web development is an ideal form of coding to start off with, and then get a full overview of it. You‚Äôll also be introduced to web design and app development.üëçüèª

                <p>My favotite app for coding is codepen.üëã CodePen is a social development environment. At its heart, it allows you to write code in the browser, and see the results of it as you build. A useful and liberating online code editor for developers of any skill, and particularly empowering for people learning to code.We say social, because CodePen is a community.<br> Most creations on CodePen are public and open source. They are living things that other people and the community can interact with, from a simple hearting, to leaving a comment, to forking and changing for their own needs.People use CodePen for all sorts of things: prototyping new ideas, reduced test cases for bugs, sending clients things to look at, evaluating potential hires, to finding inspiration.<br> People also use CodePen as a sort of resume and portfolio, showing off their best design and development work.We're trying to make CodePen a happy and healthy place for front-end designers and developers and the people looking for them, while also being a damn fine place to code. ‚ù§Ô∏èüëçüèª</p>

                <p>I am doing 3 languages right now those are html,css,JS.An overview: HTML provides the basic structure of sites, which is enhanced and modified by other technologies like CSS and JavaScript. CSS is used to control presentation, formatting, and layout. JavaScript is used to control the behavior of different elements.HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language is, as the name suggests, a markup language which is used to present the data on the web. A markup language is a language that is used to highlight the core text and provide it a structure. Here the markup is used to specify hypertext i.e. text which is a link to another resource such a page or a document. So, to convert a text document to HTML you must mark it with appropriate tags to specify it's structure.<br><br>

                    CSS - Cascading Style Sheets are, as the name suggests, stylesheets that provide styling to the already structured HTML structure. They're called cascading because the styles specified can be inherited and overridden on the basis of the structure of the HTML document.

                    JS - JavaScript is a scripting language that is used to manipulate both HTML and CSS using conditions and events. Consider that it HTML is the human body, CSS is the clothing and JS is event based set of functions or a macro that specifies the changes in the HTML and CSS from time to time.

                    Refer to W3Schools Online Web Tutorials for more information and probably a better explanation. All the best!üëãüëçüèª </p>
